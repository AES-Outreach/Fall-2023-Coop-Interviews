# OutStem Front-end Challenge

Welcome to the OutStem front-end challenge. Submission instructions are listed below. The deadline to submit this challenge is **Tuesday May 23rd, 9:00 AM**. We would like to emphasize that we are looking for effort, and that the challenge is just part of our discussion with you during the interview, so donâ€™t worry if your solution is *hacky* or even if it doesnâ€™t work, we want to see it!

## The Challenge

The challenge is to build a fun card game app, where users will be given cards from a [standard deck of playing cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck), and make guesses about the next card that will be drawn. 

The design and layout of the website is totally up to you, though you will be judged on the look, feel, and usability of your application, so do your best to respect best practices in web design.

For this challenge, we will be using the [Deck of Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/), which creates a deck of cards for you, gives you a `deck_id`, and keeps track of which cards are left as you draw cards.

## Goals

*The styling for this challenge is up to you, feel free to use any UI libraries*

This challenge has multiple goals that increase in level of difficulty, implement as many of these goals as you are able to.

### Goal 1
Fetch a new deck of cards from the API, and print the response to the console

URL: `https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/`

Example Response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "deck_id": "3p40paa87x90",
    "shuffled": false,
    "remaining": 52
}
```


### Goal 2

Ask the user if the next card will be Red or Black. You can use any input element for this, ex input, buttons, dropdown

Once they input their answer, draw a card from your deck using the API:

URL: `https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/draw/?count=1`

Example Response:
```json
{
    "success": true, 
    "deck_id": "kxozasf3edqu", 
    "cards": [
        {
            "code": "5S", 
            "image": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/5S.png", 
            "images": {
                          "svg": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/5S.svg", 
                          "png": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/5S.png"
                      }, 
            "value": "5", 
            "suit": "SPADES"
        }
    ], 
    "remaining": 50
}

```

### Goal 3

Once a rating has been submitted, load a new dog image and reset your form elements.

### Goal 4

Add a section to your app where you can review the history of your dog ratings with both the picture and rating.

Note: this does not require a database, you can use a simple client side cache that only needs to persist until the page is refreshed.

### Goal 5

Add sorting to your ratings history by highest rated and lowest rated.

### Goal 6

Add an option to filter the random dogs being provided by breed, using the list of dog breeds in the [provided file](dog-breeds.txt).

Use the [random by breed](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed) endpoint of the API for this.

`https://dog.ceo/api/breed/${BREED_HERE}/images/random`
